## Overview
The primary objective of this assignment was to utilize genetic algorithms for evolving symbolic expressions (mathematical equations) that best fit various sets of input-output pairs. 

Our task was to develop a function that processes the 2D representation of a dataset and yields the optimal symbolic expression using a genetic algorithm.

### Key Steps:
- **Dataset Transformation:** Converting the dataset into an appropriate format.
- **Solution Representation:** Deciding on an effective symbolic solution representation.
- **Fitness Function Design:** Creating a function to evaluate the quality of each solution.
- **Genetic Algorithm Implementation:** Developing and running the genetic algorithm to evolve the best solutions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Genetic Programming Libraries
- Data Processing Libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas)
